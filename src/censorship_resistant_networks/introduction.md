# Censorship-Resistant Networks

A network is a group of interconnected devices (like computers, servers, or routers) that communicate with each other using one or multiple protocols. Censorship-resistant networks are networks that implement features like P2P connections, layered routing, and decentralization techniques to make them harder to control or block.

This section covers all the networks that are either censorship-resistant on their own and are separate from the [clearnet](/appendix_a.md#clearnet) or can be used to bypass internet censorship.
