# Censorship Analysis Tools

Censorship Analysis Tools are specialized software or methods designed to detect, measure, and analyze censorship activities across different platforms and regions. These tools help researchers, activists, and organizations understand how much of the internet is censored, what content is blocked, how these censorship firewalls are evolving, and based on this data, develop strategies to circumvent these restrictions.

This section will cover tools that can be run by users, including the risks and safety measures that need to be taken before performing any analysis tests, as well as the organizations that focus on monitoring the behavior of censorship firewalls.
