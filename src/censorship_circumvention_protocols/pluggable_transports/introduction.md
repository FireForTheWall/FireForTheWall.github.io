# Pluggable Transports

Pluggable Transports are technologies used to make internet traffic more difficult to detect and, as a result, more difficult to block. Pluggable transports aren't meant to be used as VPNs or proxies to directly route traffic to the internet; instead, they need to be plugged into another protocol. For example, they might be used with SSH to make its traffic undetectable or used along with Tor to make it harder to detect.

This section will cover these pluggable transports, explain how they work, and show how you can run your own transport and use them with protocols other than just the Tor network.
