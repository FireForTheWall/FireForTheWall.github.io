# Introduction

**Fire For The Wall** is a project made in the hope of helping people to resist internet censorship. It is an ongoing and maintained guide on censorship-resistant tools, protocols, and networks, as well as the ways that censorship firewalls such as the GFW work.

The guide is organized into these sections:

- Censorship Circumvention Tools
- Censorship Circumvention Protocols
- Censorship-Resistant Networks
- Censorship Techniques
- Censorship Analysis Tools

Each document within these sections will consist of how the protocol, tool, or technique works, what the privacy and security precautions are, what implementations exist for it, and how you can set up and use them.

This guide is under the CC BY-NC 4.0 license, meaning it allows anyone to share, copy, and modify the content as long as they give appropriate credit to the original guide and do not use it for profit.

All contributions to this guide are welcome, but before making any contributions, make sure to read the [contribution guidelines](./contribution_guidelines.html) first. This will help you structure your documents and provide some rules so the guide stays consistent, even with multiple contributors working on it.
